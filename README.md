<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of SciViz is to support scientists in psychology, astronomy,
and neuroscience in creating publication-ready graphics without
requiring large amounts of coding knowledge in R. The package includes
two functions that are relevant for each discipline, but they can be
used for any subject.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SciViz from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/chenning2011/SciViz")
```
